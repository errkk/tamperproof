### Tamperproof

Circuit uses an ATTin85 to drive some ws2812 LEDS, a buzzer and a 433MHz transmitter.

When energised the chip starts a count down, and displays a countdowny looking pattern on a NeoPizel ring. When the time is up (set by the analog input form a potentiometer) the pattern turns urgent and neenaw-y, the buzzer sounds and a radio distress signal is sent.

The lesson to learn here is don't knick the Tamper.
